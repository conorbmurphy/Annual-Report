# Annual Report: A Quantified Self Project

This repository contains a presentation to the Chicago quantified self meetup group of my second annual report.  For three years, I've been tracking data on my mood, behaviors (such as meditation and exercise), goals, etc using the app Reporter and conducting analysis in R.  The general goal has been to find the closest correlates to positive and negative affect.

Over the course of this analysis, I have found that meditation and exercise have a strong positive correlation with my mood.  I've also found that teaching and public speaking positively correlate to my mood as well.
